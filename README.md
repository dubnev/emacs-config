# Emacs Configuration

Will always be a WIP.

Specific to me, but mostly portable as long as using Emacs for Mac OS.

Literate config, see `config.org` for the up-to-date configuation.

`yasnippet-snippets` for relevant languages pulled from [this lovely collection](https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets).
