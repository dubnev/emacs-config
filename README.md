# dubnev Emacs Configuration

Will always be a WIP.

Specific to me, but mostly portable as long as using Emacs for Mac OS.

Check out `init.el`, and then the meat of the configuration is in `configuration.org`.

`yasnippet-snippets` for relevant languages pulled from [this lovely collection](https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets).
